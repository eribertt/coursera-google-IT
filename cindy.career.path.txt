I'd say when I first started, I thought there were two jobs you could do. You
could be a Sys Admin or you could be IT support. But that's completely false.
There's a huge amounts of opportunity in IT You could be specialized in
networks, you could be specialized in databases or like reliability engineering.
I'd say it doesn't matter if you're a guy, a girl, an alien, IT is for everyone.
It's just problem solving with technology. Anyone can do it. I know people who
are in IT that have degrees in like liberal arts or like cooking and all these
other things. People come from IT from all sorts of backgrounds. I've always
strived to be different and for me, I think that was just learning skills like
growing up girls didn't use computers. I'm like, "Oh, no, you use a computer."
Girls didn't know how to drive manual cars, I'm going to go and learn how to
drive a manual car. They don't know how to ride motorcycles. I can do that, too.
And I enjoy learning. I enjoy learning a lot of things. I enjoy picking up new
skills. Technology is a real equalizer. For people who don't have the current
educational background, you can load up a website, you can go to Coursera, all
these learning websites. There's so much information on the internet. I think
that technology really equalizes that for people who want to get into certain
careers, if they want to learn something. What's available now is amazing and I
wish I had that ten years ago when I started.
