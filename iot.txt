You may have heard of the phrase Internet of Things or IoT. This concept is
pretty new but already has a major impact on the future of computing. The
concept is fairly simple. Basically, more and more devices are being connected
to the internet in a smarter fashion. Did you know that there are now smart
thermostats? Instead of manually programming them when you'll be out of the
house, they'll just know when you leave and turn off the air conditioning for
you. And it's not just your thermostat, many companies out there are making
smarter household devices. There are fridges that can keep track of what foods
you have in their, toasters that can be controlled by your smartphone, lights
that can change depending on your mood and cars that drive you instead of you
driving them. The world is moving towards connecting manual devices to the
internet and making them smarter. These decisions have many societal
implications though, especially when it comes to cybersecurity or personal
privacy. But there's also a huge potential for IoT to completely transforme the
world in ways we have yet to see. In the future, people may be shocked to learn
that we had to do manual things like, make your own coffee or drive to the
grocery store. While you may not experience working with an Internet of Things
device, you should be aware that it will become a large part of the future of
computing. You can learn more about IoT in the next supplementary reading.
