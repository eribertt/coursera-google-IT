Let us take a look at examples of good and not-so-good documentation. Here is
the deal. You encounter a strange issue when helping a user out. This issue
happens so often that you and your colleagues have encountered it. No
documentation is the worse documentation. Imagine if it took you hours to figure
out an issue to a problem and you didn't write it down. Your colleague
encounters the same issue and takes hours to figure it out. Then, he also does
not write it down. This can go on and on. It only takes a little bit of effort
to create documentation, and it can save you so much of your time, your
company's time, and your users time. Okay. This is not the best example of
documentation. The problem the IT support specialist stated is not specific, and
it leaves you with more questions than answers. And while it tells you what will
fix an issue, it does not tell you how. Documentation should be straight and
clear-cut. Your reader should not have any questions when following the
instructions you listed. Now, this is a good example of documentation. It starts
off with a very specific and clear problem. It gives you background information
on what the issue is. It even gives you the exact instructions on how to fix the
issue, including which settings to navigate to and where. Remember, always write
documentation that makes it easy for your reader to follow.
